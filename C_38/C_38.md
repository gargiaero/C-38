# Topic Real Car Racing

## GOALS:

#### ● Add a track in the background. 

#### ● Replace the car sprites with images of real cars.

####  ● Write a condition to end the game.

#### STEPS:

1.  clone the previous class code or download the images needed for the project and add to his/her previously written code.

   *  makes sure that they API keys are from their database.

     

2.  load all the images needed in the code. 

   * Where should we load the image in our code?

     > > In function preload() [inside sketch.js] 

     

   *  What function is used to load the image? 

     > > loadImage() 

     ```javascript
     var track, car1_img, car2_img, car3_img, car4_img;
     function preload(){
       track = loadImage("../images/track.jpg");
       car1_img = loadImage("../images/car1.png");
       car2_img = loadImage("../images/car2.png");
       car3_img = loadImage("../images/car3.png");
       car4_img = loadImage("../images/car4.png");
       ground = loadImage("../images/ground.png");
     }
     ```

     

   * Awesome, let's load all the images. 

   * We have 5 images in total. 

     > - ground 
     > - track 
     > - 4 images for the cars 

      Note:

      Use absolute path for the image files here. 

      Absolute path example: C:\Documents\CarRacingG ame\images\car1.png

     C:\Desktop\whitehat_coding\class_38\CarRacingStage1.5-master(1)

      Relative path example: images\car1.png

* add all the images to the different cars in game.js

* give absolute path for all the images.

  ```javascript
  async start(){
      if(gameState === 0)
      {
        player = new Player();
        var playerCountRef = await database.ref('playerCount').once("value");
        if(playerCountRef.exists())
        {
          playerCount = playerCountRef.val();
          player.getCount();
        }
        form = new Form()
        form.display();
      }
  
      car1 = createSprite(100,200);
      car1.addImage("car1",car1_img);
      car2 = createSprite(300,200);
      car2.addImage("car2",car2_img);
      car3 = createSprite(500,200);
      car3.addImage("car3",car3_img);
      car4 = createSprite(700,200);
      car4.addImage("car4",car4_img);
      cars = [car1, car2, car3, car4];
    }
  
   
  ```

  

3.  load a ground and the track where the car racing game will take place. We can use ground image or a ground color as the background in game.js

   ​								4. we can add track image in the game.

   *  refers to the image() documentation to understand the different arguments it takes.
   * The track image is very long. We want it to start even before 0, 0. Let's start it at 0,-displayHeight*4 This will start the track image 4 times above above our screen origin. We could give a higher number if we wanted a longer track! We also want our image to occupy a width and height of displayWidth, displayHeight*5. We want the image to cover the track starting from the origin. Because we want the screen to be covered with the track.

```javascript
 play(){
    form.hide();
    
    Player.getPlayerInfo();
    
    if(allPlayers !== undefined){
      background(rgb(198,135,103));
      image(track, 0,-displayHeight*4,displayWidth, displayHeight*5);
      
      //var display_position = 100;
      
      //index of the array
      var index = 0;

      //x and y position of the cars
      var x = 175 ;
      var y;

      for(var plr in allPlayers){
        //add 1 to the index for every loop
        index = index + 1 ;

        //position the cars a little away from each other in x direction
        x = x + 200;
        //use data form the database to display the cars in y direction
        y = displayHeight - allPlayers[plr].distance;
        cars[index-1].x = x;
        cars[index-1].y = y;

        if (index === player.index){
          cars[index - 1].shapeColor = "red";
          camera.position.x = displayWidth/2;
          camera.position.y = cars[index-1].y;
        }
       
        //textSize(15);
        //text(allPlayers[plr].name + ": " + allPlayers[plr].distance, 120,display_position)
      }

    }

    if(keyIsDown(UP_ARROW) && player.index !== null){
      player.distance +=10
      player.update();
    }

   
    drawSprites();
  }

}
```

5. opens the Firebase console.

   *  Make sure that the gameState and playCount is 0.
   *  run the code in 4 different browsers to see the output.
   * align the cars. We just need to change the values of x. Experiment : var x =175 in play function in game.js

6. write a condition to end the game when the player reaches the end sign on the road in game.s inside play function

   ```javascript
     if(player.distance > 3860){
         gameState = 2;
       }
      
   ```

   

7. write an end() function inside Game Class and call this using game object in our sketch.js file.

   * We will update the gameState in our database here. Also, we will print on the console that the game has ended.

   ```javascript
    end(){
       console.log("Game Ended");
      game.update(2);
     }
   ```
